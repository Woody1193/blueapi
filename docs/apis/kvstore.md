# KvStore API

```note
OpenAPI documentation: [https://alphauslabs.github.io/blueapidocs/#/KvStore](https://alphauslabs.github.io/blueapidocs/#/KvStore)
```

All Alphaus clients have a free, limited access to our KvStore, a highly-available, distributed key/value store that is easily accessible using `curl`, or [`bluectl`](https://github.com/alphauslabs/bluectl), or using any of the [gRPC-supported programming languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

The free version is limited to a regional store closest to you where data is replicated across three zones, and a size limit of around ~100Mb. If you want to have access to an unlimited version, one that is either regional, multi-region, or even a globally-distributed version (replicated across multiple regions across multiple continents), please contact our Sales/Support team.
