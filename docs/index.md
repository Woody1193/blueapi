Blue API is [Alphaus](https://alphaus.cloud/en/)' unified platform API for [Ripple](https://alphaus.cloud/en/product/ripple/) and [Wave](https://alphaus.cloud/en/product/wave/). It uses [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for its service and message definitions, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for implementation and SDK generation, and [grpc-gateway](https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/) for gRPC-to-REST proxy and OpenAPI document generation.
